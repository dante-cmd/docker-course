    "### How does a container work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Container Image (The Blueprint): Before a container can run, it must be packaged into a **Container Image**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Definition:** An image is a static, immutable file that contains everything needed to run an application: the application code, a runtime (like Python or Java), essential system libraries, binaries, and configuration files.\n",
    "    * **Layering:** Images are built using a stack of **read-only layers**. When you make a change (e.g., install a package), a new layer is created. This layering system is highly efficient, as identical base layers can be shared among many different images, reducing disk usage.\n",
    "    * **Read-Only Filesystem:** When a container starts, the image layers form the foundation, creating a read-only filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Container Instantiation (The Running Process): When you run an image (creating a container), the container runtime (like Docker Engine) leverages kernel features to isolate the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **The Container is a Process:** Fundamentally, a container is just an **isolated process** running on the host OS.\n",
    "    * **The Writable Layer:** The container runtime adds a thin, **writable layer** on top of the image's read-only layers. All changes the running application makes (new files, logs, etc.) are written to this layer, preserving the immutability of the underlying image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Core Isolation Technologies: The isolation that makes a container feel like a separate machine is achieved through two main Linux kernel features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A. Namespaces (Isolation/Visibility)\n",
    "    Namespaces provide the illusion of a completely separate operating system by isolating specific system resources. They control **what a container can see**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    | Namespace | What it Isolates (What the Container Sees) | Example |\n",
    "    | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "    | **PID** (Process ID) | The process tree. | The container's main process appears as **PID 1** inside the container, and it cannot see processes running outside of it on the host. |\n",
    "    | **NET** (Network) | The network stack. | The container gets its own IP address, routing table, and network interfaces, separate from the host's and other containers'. |\n",
    "    | **MNT** (Mount) | The filesystem mount points. | The container sees its own root filesystem (defined by the image) and cannot access the host's files unless explicitly mounted. |\n",
    "    | **UTS** (Hostname) | Hostname and domain name. | The container can have its own unique hostname. |\n",
    "    | **User** | User and group IDs. | Allows a user to be `root` inside the container, but be mapped to an unprivileged user on the host for security. |\n",
    "\n",
    "    B. Control Groups (cgroups) (Resource Management)\n",
    "    Cgroups are responsible for **managing and limiting the resources** a container can consume. They control **what a container can use**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Resource Limits:** Cgroups prevent a single rogue container from consuming all of a host's resources.\n",
    "    * **Examples:** You can use cgroups to limit a container to a specific amount of **CPU time**, **RAM**, **network bandwidth**, and **disk I/O**."

    "     ```bash\n",
    "     docker volume create my_volume\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "   - Data stored in volumes is stored outside the container's filesystem, making it persistent even if the container is deleted.\n",
